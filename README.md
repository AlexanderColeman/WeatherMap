In this project, I utilized Open Weather Map API to be able return the current temperature of an enter city in a C# .NET console app. 
I used a generated API key and API call to access the data response. 
Next I used the NewtonSoft.Json Nuget package to parse the API response to return an easier-to-read formatted response.
